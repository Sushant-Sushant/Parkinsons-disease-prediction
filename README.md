# Parkinsons-disease-prediction
This project aims to predict the presence of Parkinson's disease in individuals using machine learning techniques.

Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the models is sourced from [insert dataset source/link]. It includes features such as age, gender, motor scores, and other relevant clinical data.

Machine Learning Models
We have implemented and compared the following machine learning models for Parkinson's disease prediction:

Logistic Regression
Random Forest Classifier
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
